description: "Fifty-One Tales is a collection of fantasy short stories by Irish writer\
  \ Lord Dunsany, considered a major influence on the work of J. R. R. Tolkien, H.\
  \ P. Lovecraft, Ursula K. Le Guin and others. The first editions, in hardcover,\
  \ were published simultaneously in London and New York by Elkin Mathews and Mitchell\
  \ Kennerly, respectively, in April, 1915. The British and American editions differ\
  \ in that they arrange the material slightly differently and that each includes\
  \ a story the other omits; \"The Poet Speaks with Earth\" in the British version,\
  \ and \"The Mist\" in the American version.\nThe collection's significance in the\
  \ history of fantasy literature was recognized by its republication (as The Food\
  \ of Death: Fifty-One Tales) by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the third volume\
  \ of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library in September, 1974. The Newcastle edition\
  \ used the American version of the text.\nThe book collects fifty-one short stories\
  \ by the author.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
